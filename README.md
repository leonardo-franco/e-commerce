## Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Develop an E-commerce website as a portfolio piece that showcases skills in both front-end and back-end development, software architecture, testing, and security. This project will comply with LGPD, ensuring user data privacy and application security.

**Scope:**  
- A responsive, intuitive interface for browsing products, managing the catalog, and handling checkout.
- A back-end system for managing users, products, orders, and transactions.
- A robust authentication and authorization system.
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring for auditing and incident detection.
- Complete documentation focusing on security and privacy best practices.

## Technologies and Frameworks

**Front-End:**  
- **Language:** JavaScript (ES6+)
- **Framework/Library:**  
  - **React.js** or **Next.js** (for SSR and enhanced SEO)
  - **Redux** or **Context API** for state management
- **CSS:**  
  - CSS Modules, Styled Components, or frameworks like Tailwind CSS/Bootstrap for responsive design
- **Build Tools:** Webpack, Babel

**Back-End:**  
- **Language:** JavaScript (Node.js) or TypeScript
- **Framework:** Express.js or Nest.js (for a more modular and robust architecture)
- **Database:**  
  - SQL: PostgreSQL or MySQL to ensure data integrity and security  
  - NoSQL Alternative: MongoDB, if horizontal scalability is required
- **APIs:** RESTful or GraphQL, with proper documentation (Swagger or GraphQL Playground)

**Other Components:**  
- **Authentication and Authorization:** JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and OAuth2 for secure integrations
- **Infrastructure:**  
  - Docker for containerization and environment isolation
  - CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions or Jenkins for automated testing and deployment

## Methodology and Planning

**Development Methodology:**  
- **Agile (Scrum or Kanban):**  
  - Weekly or bi-weekly sprints with incremental deliveries
  - Daily stand-up meetings and regular retrospectives for continuous improvement

**Timeline and Milestones:**  
- Requirements gathering and documentation – **2 weeks**
- Front-end and back-end development – **4 to 6 weeks**
- Integration and testing – **2 to 3 weeks**
- Security audit and LGPD adjustments – **2 weeks**
- Deployment and monitoring – **1 week**

## Functional and Non-Functional Requirements

**Functional Requirements:**  
- **User Management:**  
  - User registration and authentication with email verification.
- **Product Catalog:**  
  - Detailed product listings with search, filters, and category navigation.
- **Shopping Cart & Checkout:**  
  - Add-to-cart functionality, checkout process, and integration with simulated payment systems.
- **Administration Panel:**  
  - Management of products, orders, and user accounts.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**  
- **Security:**  
  - Data encryption for sensitive information and protection against common vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF, SQL Injection).
- **Performance:**  
  - Optimized assets and implementation of lazy loading for images and components.
- **Scalability:**  
  - A modular architecture designed for future expansion.
- **Usability:**  
  - A responsive, accessible, and user-friendly design.

## Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests:**  
- Use **Jest** or **Mocha/Chai** to test individual functions and components in isolation.

**Integration Tests:**  
- Verify the interaction between different modules, such as the communication between the front-end and back-end.

**End-to-End (E2E) Tests:**  
- Implement tests with **Cypress** or **Selenium** to simulate complete user flows (e.g., registration, navigation, purchase).

**Security Tests:**  
- Conduct vulnerability assessments (SAST and DAST) to identify and mitigate risks.
- Regular code audits and manual reviews focused on security best practices.

**Test Documentation:**  
- Develop a comprehensive test plan outlining scenarios, acceptance criteria, and success metrics.

## LGPD Compliance

**Privacy Policies and Consent:**  
- Develop a clear privacy policy detailing how data is collected, used, and stored.
- Implement consent forms for personal data processing with options for revocation.
- Inform users about cookie usage and tracking, providing opt-in/opt-out choices.

**Data Security:**  
- Encrypt data in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest.
- Enforce robust access controls with differentiated permission levels for users and administrators.
- Store sensitive data securely and avoid unnecessary data retention.

**Data Subject Rights:**  
- Provide mechanisms for users to request access, correction, or deletion of their data.
- Maintain logs of consent and data access for audits and LGPD compliance.

**Monitoring and Auditing:**  
- Use monitoring tools and anomaly detection systems.
- Establish backup routines and disaster recovery plans.

## Security Strategy

**Security Layers:**  
- **Front-End:**  
  - Data validation and sanitization, protection against script injections, and enforcement of a Content Security Policy (CSP).
- **Back-End:**  
  - Use of updated frameworks and libraries, strict input validation, and secure error handling.
- **Communication:**  
  - Enforce HTTPS for all client-server communications.

**Best Practices:**  
- Regular code reviews focused on security.
- Routine updates of dependencies and libraries.
- Scheduled penetration tests (Pentests) and vulnerability assessments.
